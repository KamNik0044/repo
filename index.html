            <h2>Tech Career</h2>
            <p>First of all, I would like to say I did not know anything about coding, and after 3,4 months of learning, I became interested in it. I have experience working with computers and while I was doing advertising work in my country, I took a 3-month course in Microsoft Office and worked for years with Word and Excel. I must say that I am familiar with computers and I have always been able to solve issues by searching. I am aware that I have a long journey in coding and I would love to be the best coder in the future.</p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmXOO4NmKXY&amp;t=620s"></iframe>
